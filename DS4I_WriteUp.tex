In this study, we embarked on descriptive analysis of the content of the
State of\\
Nations Address speeches by South African presidents from 1994 to 2022.
We uti-\\
lizing advanced sentiment analysis, and topic modelling techniques to
quantified\\
the emotional tone of each speech and general topics that will provide
context and\\
understanding to the broader socio-political environment of South Africa
over time.\\
We utilized the Afinn lexicon which is a list of English terms manually
rated for\\
valence with an integer between -5 (negative) and +5 (positive).

\subsubsection{Yearly Trends}\label{yearly-trends}}

Figure 1 displays the average sentiment segregated by year and
president. Nelson\\
Mandela's term, symbolizing the dawn of democracy in South Africa
manifested\\
positive sentiment scores. However, there is a sharp decline after that
from 1995-\\
1999. Furthermore, we notice that Mbeki in the early 2000's had more
positive\\
sentiment as compared to the late 90's. However, this sentiment
diminishes over\\
his tenure, possibly indicating challenges or controversial issues faced
during his\\
presidency. Zuma's term showcases dramatic peaks and valleys in
sentiment scores.\\
We notice a steady increase in positive sentiment in the late 2000's
peaking in 2010\\
at a sentiment score of 1.25. Various factors could be investigated for
this. A possible\\
reason for this is the 2010 FIFA World Cup that was hosted in South
Africa.\\
However, after the world cup (2010) we notice a volatile pattern
associated with\\
Zuma's tenure as contrast to the high witnessed in 2010, there was a
drop leading\\
to a sentiment score of below 0.5 in 2013.\\
Furthermore, ever since Ramaphosa has been elected into office in 2018,
we notice\\
a steady decline in sentiment score. A possible reason for this could be
the load-\\
shedding and Coronavirus struggles that have plagued our country in
recent years.\\
These will be further investigated in the section.

Figure 2 echos the analysis that is portrayed in Figure 1. A further
comment can\\
be extremely negative or positive sentiments (-5 and 5) are sparsely
represented\\
across the years, indicating that highly polarized sentiments are rare
in the dataset.\\
Throughout most of the years, the neutral sentiment (values 1 and 2)
remains pre-\\
dominant, suggesting a generally stable mood or balanced content in the
analyzed\\
texts.

\subsubsection{Decade Trends}\label{decade-trends}}

Within the span of three decades, Figure 3 illustrates the average
sentiment per\\
decade. The 2000s and 2010s emerge as periods marked by heightened
positive\\
sentiment. In contrast, the 1990s and the 2020s manifest a more tempered
positivity.\\

Trends}\label{pre-and-post-election-trends}}

Figure 4 depicts the average sentiment during the pre and post-election
phases for\\
several South African presidents, namely Mandela, Mbeki, Ramaphosa, and
Zuma.\\
Analyzing the sentiment before the elections (pre) for each president
reveals a trend.\\
Generally, the sentiment before the election is comparatively more
negative or less\\
positive than the post-election phase. This pattern could be attributed
to the strategic communication employed during election campaigns.
It\textquotesingle s common during election campaigns for leaders or
political parties to highlight existing problems or crises to win voter
trust by promising solutions. By making the situation seem more
critical, candidates can position themselves as the needed change.

\hypertarget{overall-trends}{%
\subsubsection{Overall Trends}\label{overall-trends}}

It is found that the SONA\textquotesingle s generally expressed positive
sentiments post-elections,\\
as supposed to pre-elections. Another finding, indicated a more negative
sentiment\\
in the speeches during the 1990s and the 2020s when juxtaposed against
the relatively more positive undertones from 2000 to 2020. These
sentiment shifts keenly reflect the changing political landscape and
challenges faced in South Africa during these periods. Overall, our
findings reveal distinct shifts in the emotional undertones of
presidential speeches over time, providing insights into the evolving
political narratives and concerns of the nation.
