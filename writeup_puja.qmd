# Data and Methods

## Data Collection

As the aim of this project was to analyse SONA speeches before and after the election of the President of South Africa, the data used for this project were SONA speeches from 1994 through to 2023. These were accessed from the South African Government website (*https://www.gov.za/state-nation-address*) and include speeches from six presidents: FW de Klerk, Nelson Mandela, Thabo Mbeki, Kgalema Motlanthe, Jacob Zuma and the current president, Cyril Ramaphosa. Overall, 36 speeches were analysed. How these speeches were analysed will be explained in the sections to come.
